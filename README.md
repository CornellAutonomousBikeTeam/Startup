Raspberry Pi Startup Scripts


These will probably be edited for the Nav team to be able to run straight tests for the bike. 

The goal of these scripts would be for the bike to be able to run the start script, have the landing gear lift up, and have the bike be able to just start running. When the bike calls the end script, the landing gear would be called. Thus, these scripts will not be appropriate for people running simple balance tests who do not want the bike to just run away.
